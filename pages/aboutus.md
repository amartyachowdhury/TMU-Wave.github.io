Welcome to TMU's newest design team.

### Our story
TMU WAVE is Toronto Metropolitan University's first underwater robotics team, focused on designing and developing an innovative, economical, and environmentally friendly Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). Our team is made up of students from various disciplines, all coming together to break new ground in underwater exploration and tackle real-world engineering challenges. From structural design to software development, our goal is to build a cutting-edge ROV that can perform in a variety of underwater environments. As we prepare to compete in the MATE ROV 2025 competition, our work supports scientific research, addresses industry challenges, and advances sustainable underwater technology for the future.
